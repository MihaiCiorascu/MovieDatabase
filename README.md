# Movie Database

This project is a Movie Database application implemented in **C++** using the **Qt Framework** for its graphical user interface. It allows users to manage a collection of movies efficiently and intuitively.

## Features

- **Movie Management**:
  - Add, update, delete and list movies in the database.
  - Store and retrieve movie data persistently using file handling.

- **Graphical User Interface**:
  - Built with **Qt Widgets** for a modern and responsive interface.
  - Supports viewing and editing movie details with Model-View architecture.

- **Console Interface**:
  - Provides a command-line interface as an alternative to the GUI for managing movies.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Utilized inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation for modular and reusable code.
  
- **Smart Pointers**:
  - Managed memory safely using RAII principles with C++ smart pointers.

- **File Handling**:
  - Enabled persistent storage for movie data.

- **Qt Framework**:
  - Used for GUI development, leveraging layouts, widgets and the signals-and-slots mechanism.
  
- **Model-View Architecture**:
  - Separated data from its visual representation for efficient and scalable user interfaces.

## Additional Notes

This project demonstrates a blend of modern C++ features and Qt's capabilities, providing a robust and user-friendly application for movie management.
